You should have trusted me

lt was the possibility
of losing you

or the certainty of losing
all those other agents.

decision l could
and you know it.

into the environmental
control system,

292
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,108
locked out
the safety protocols

293
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,612
and turned on the gas,
all of which should
have been impossible.

294
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,114
On top of that,
they hacked into her files.

295

They knew her appointments,
knew she'd be out
of the building.

They weren't targeting her.

The old building was declared
"strategically vulnerable".

We've attempted to trace
the computer message, but

317
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,025
it was sent by an asymmetrical
